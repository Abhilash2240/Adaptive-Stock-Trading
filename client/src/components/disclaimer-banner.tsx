                      This platform is designed exclusively for educational and research purposes to demonstrate 
                      reinforcement learning techniques applied to financial markets. It is NOT intended to provide

                      Nothing on this platform should be construed as professional financial advice, recommendation, 
                      or endorsement to buy or sell any security or financial instrument. Always consult with a

                      Past performance, whether real or simulated, is not indicative of future results. Backtested 
                      performance does not represent actual trading and may not reflect the impact of material economic

                    <p>
                      Trading and investing in financial markets involves substantial risk of loss. You can lose some 
                      or all of your investment capital. Never invest money you cannot afford to lose.

                    <p>
                      While we strive for accuracy, this platform and its AI models may contain errors, bugs, or 
                      inaccuracies. The reinforcement learning models are experimental and may produce unpredictable 
                      results.

                    <p>
                      By default, this platform operates in Paper Trading mode using simulated funds. No real money 
                      is at risk. Any "Live Trading" mode requires explicit multi-step confirmation and should only 
                      be used by experienced traders who understand the risks.
